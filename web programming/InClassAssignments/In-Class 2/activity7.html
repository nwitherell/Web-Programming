 <p> The way I would define it is to have a CSS for the average case in which the website would be setup. 
I would set class tags for bg color, department style, and the way tables are set to look like. <br>
The CSS would be easy to modify, as each tag would have universalr properties, but be easily modifieble for each departments needs
.background - background color<br>
.departmentStyle - each departments style<br>
.configureTable - used for non-specified tables<br>
.exam - for online tests<br>
.calender - for the overall schedule<br>
.sheet - for average online documents to show off<br>
.timeTable -for schedule on a per day basis<br>
.header - the header<br>
.title - for the name of the class or department<br>
.info - for general info in each class<br>

 </body>
