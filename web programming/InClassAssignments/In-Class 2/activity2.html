 <style> 
 BODY {font-family : "times new roman; 
 margin-left : 20%; 
 margin-right: 20%; 
 text-align : justify; 
 background : ivory;
 color : red;} 
 P {text-indent : 2cm;} 
 h1,h2,h3{ color:red ; marginleft:2cm} 
 </style>  
 </head>   
 <body>
 <p> There was a space in the style tag, which would write out the styles onto the page as average text.
 <br>Also there was no /html tag but I dont know if that's an error, and BODY was fully capitilized"
